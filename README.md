## Files Overview

### 1. `index.html` (Main Dashboard)

- **Purpose:** Displays the test execution summary and detailed results in a polished, interactive table.
- **How it works:**  
  - Uses JavaScript to fetch test results from `results.json` (either from GitHub Pages or user upload).
  - Renders a summary box (status, start/end time, counts).
  - Populates a table with each test's details.
  - Failed tests are clickable to show/hide their exception logs.
  - Uses [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) for sorting, searching, and styling.
  - Includes a navigation menu for switching between the dashboard and FAQ.
  - Allows users to upload their own JSON file and validates its structure before displaying results.
  - Footer displays SparkSoft Corp branding.

### 2. `faq.html` (Frequently Asked Questions)

- **Purpose:** Provides answers to common questions about the dashboard and its usage.
- **How it works:**  
  - Styled to match the main dashboard, using the same color scheme and Garamond font.
  - Features a navigation menu for easy access to both pages.
  - FAQ items are expandable/collapsible for a clean, interactive experience.
  - Footer matches the main dashboard for consistent branding.

### 3. `results.json` (Test Results Data)

- **Purpose:** Stores the test results in JSON format.
- **How it works:**  
  - Contains summary info (status, start/end time, counts).
  - Contains a list of test cases, each with name, status, times, and exception log (if failed).
  - Is read by the dashboard to display results.
  - Can be replaced by user-uploaded files for custom viewing.

---

### 4. `generate_fake_results.py` (Sample Data Generator)

- **Purpose:** Generates a fake `results.json` file for demo/testing.
- **How it works:**  
  - Randomly creates test results with a majority passing, a few failing/skipped/in progress.
  - Outputs a JSON file (`results.json`) in the same directory.
  - Run this script to refresh the test data:
    ```
    python generate_fake_results.py
    ```
